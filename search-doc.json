A property graph is composed of the following building blocks: Nodes and their types. Nodes represent program constructs. This includes low-level language constructs such as methods, variables, and control structures, but also higher level constructs such as HTTP endpoints or findings. Each node has a type. The type indicates the type of program construct represented by the node, e.g., a node with the type METHOD represents a method while a node with type LOCAL represents the declaration of a local variable. Labeled directed edges.Relations between program constructs are represented via edges between their corresponding nodes. For example, to express that a method contains a local variable, we can create an edge with the label CONTAINS from the method's node to the local's node. By using labeled edges, we can represent multiple types of relations in the same graph. Moreover, edges are directed to express, e.g., that the method contains the local but not the other way around. Multiple edges may exist between the same two nodes. Key-Value Pairs.Nodes carry key-value pairs (attributes), where the valid keys depend on the node type. For example, a method has at least a name and a signature while a local declaration has at least the name and the type of the declared variable. In summary, code property graphs are directed, edge-labeled, attributed multigraphs, and we insist that each node carries at least one attribute that indicates its type. note A Look into the Rear-View Mirror The Code Property Graph was first introduced in the paper Modeling and Discovering Vulnerabilities with Code Property Graphs in the context of vulnerability discovery for C system code and the Linux kernel in particular. The core ideas outlined in this early work are the following: Different classic program representations are merged into a property graph into a single data structure that holds information about the program’s syntax, control- and intra-procedural data-flow. The property graph is stored in a graph database and made accessible via a domain specific language (DSL) for the identification of programming patterns - based on a DSL for graph traversals. The query language allows to seamlessly transition between the original code representations, making it possible to combine aspects of the code from different views these representations offer in a single query. From 2014-2016, research followed on (a) extending the concept for interprocedural analysis, (b) using the graph as a basis for learning typical data-flow patterns in a program, (c) the effects of introducing further classic program representations such as dominator trees, (d) and the applicability of the approach for dynamically-typed languages such as PHP. From 2017 onwards, the code property graph served as the technological foundation for the static analysis solutions developed at ShiftLeft Inc. The representation has since undergone heavy extensions and transformations. At the statement and expression level, it has matured into a generic container format which allows for hosting of graphs generated by 8 different language frontends, to enable querying with the same query language across programming languages. Moreover, the concept of overlays was introduced to allow representing code on different levels of abstraction, enabling transitioning between these layers of abstraction using the query language in the same way as for the original three low-level code representations. Finally, programming models and APIs are now available for parallel graph processing at low memory footprint - a core ingredient for scaling the approach.

It calls a function called source on line 2 and stores its result in an integer called x. A subsequent check on line 3 determines whether x is smaller than a constant MAX, and if so, the value of 2*x is stored in y on line 4 and passed as an argument to the function sink on line 5. We can import this code snippet directly on the Joern shell. importCode.c.fromString(code) Copy Once imported, we can plot the abstract syntax tree of foo to get a first idea of what an abstract syntax tree is. cpg.method.name(\"foo\").plotDotAst Copy Fig.1: Abstract Syntax Tree for function `foo`. (Click to zoom in) As shown in the sample plot in Figure 1, an abstract syntax tree is a tree-like structure that makes the decomposition of code into its language constructs explicit. The tree consists of nodes and edgesvisualized in the plot as ellipses and arrows respectively. Nodes represent language constructs such as methods, variables, and control structures, while edges indicate decomposition. For example, at the very top of the tree, we see a node representing the entire function foo, and directly beneath it, we see a node for the return type void and one for the function body, denoted as a BLOCK. The edges between the function- and the two other nodes indicates that the function can be decomposed into a return type and a block of code, and outgoing edges from BLOCK show that this block of code can be further decomposed. note In the plot, the pair (type,attribute) is displayed in each node, where type is the node type and attribute is one of the values that is particularly indicative for the node, e.g., the method name for method nodes. We make an exception for calls, where we display the pair (name,attribute). "},{"title":"Basic AST Traversals","type":1,"pageTitle":"Syntax-Tree Queries","url":"c-syntaxtree#basic-ast-traversals","content":"The most basic traversal that you can execute on any AST node is ast, which traverses to all nodes of the AST rooted in the node. For example, cpg.method(\"foo\").ast.l Copy gives you all AST nodes of the AST for the method foo. As each AST node is also the root of a subtree, you can also think of this operation as an enumeration of all subtrees. These can be filtered by type. For example, cpg.method(\"foo\").ast.isCall.code.l Copy gives you all outgoing calls from foo while cpg.method(\"foo\").ast.isControlStructure.code.l Copy gives you all control structures. For method nodes, we also offer shorthands for the most common node types. Using these shorthands, the two queries can be written as cpg.method(\"foo\").call.code.l Copy and cpg.method(\"foo\").controlStructure.code.l Copy respectively. It is also possible to walk the tree upwards using inAst orinAstMinusLeaf where the latter excludes the start node. In our running example, consider for example the situation where it is known that calls to source return values that an attacker can influence. cpg.call.name(\"source\").inAstMinusLeaf.isCall.name(\".*assignment.*\").argument(1).l Copy The query begins by selecting all calls to source, encoded in the graph as nodes of type CALL with a string property called namethat is set to \"source\". From there, we walk edges backwards until we reach the method node using inAstMinusLeaf. For the set of nodes thus collected, we determine only those which are calls (isCall) to the assignment operator .name(\".*assignment.*\"). For each of these, we determine their first argument, the assignment target. As certain operators exist across programming languages and operating on them via AST-queries is common, we have created a decorator language to simplify these queries. In practice, we would write the following query that is equivalent to the former query. cpg.call(\"source\").inAssignment.target.l Copy "},{"title":"Control Structures","type":1,"pageTitle":"Syntax-Tree Queries","url":"c-syntaxtree#control-structures","content":"Abstract syntax trees include control structures such as if-,while or for-statements. Our example program contains only a single control structure, namely, the if-statement on line 3. Fig.3: Control structure in the abstract syntax tree. The subtree on the left represents the condition, the subtree on the right is the compound statement. Figure 3 shows how if-statements are represented in the syntax tree. The tree consists of two sub trees, one that holds the conditionx < MAX and another that holds the statements in theif-block. Conditions can be selected as follows: cpg.method(\"foo\").controlStructure.condition.code.l => List(\"x < MAX\") Copy The body of the if-statement can be selected using whenTrue: cpg.method(\"foo\").controlStructure.whenTrue.l res41: List[AstNode] = List( Block( id -> 1000110L, argumentIndex -> 2, argumentName -> None, code -> \"\", columnNumber -> Some(value = 4), lineNumber -> Some(value = 5), order -> 2, typeFullName -> \"void\" ) ) Copy For if-else constructs, whenFalse returns the else block, however, since no else block exists in our example, an empty list is returned: cpg.method(\"foo\").controlStructure.whenFalse.l => List[AstNode] = List() Copy As each of the nodes returned by .ast are also roots of syntax trees, we can identify nested structures by chaining basic operations. cpg.method(\"foo\").controlStructure.whenTrue.ast.isCall.code.l => List[String] = List(\"y = 2*x\", \"sink(y)\", \"2*x\") Copy yields all calls nested inside if blocks. You may ask yourself why2*x is returned as a call. The reason is that we model all invocations of built-in operators as calls to methods with the name<operator>.$operatorName, where $operatorName may for example be \"multiplication\", or \"assignment\". One example scenario where control structure access comes in handy is when you wish to determine all methods that call a specific function but do not include a necessary check. Say, for example, that we want to identify functions that call source but they do not include a check against MAX. The following query achieves this: cpg.method.filter(_.controlStructure(\".*MAX.*\").isEmpty) .filter(_.callee.name(\".*source.*\").nonEmpty).l => List() Copy Note, however, that the query does not specify the oder in which these statements must occur, e.g., the check may happen too late. Control flow graphs and dominator trees are the right tools to reason about statement order. These structures are available in the code property graph as well, but we do not discuss them in this article. "},{"title":"Nesting of control structures","type":1,"pageTitle":"Syntax-Tree Queries","url":"c-syntaxtree#nesting-of-control-structures","content":"Let us modify our example code slightly as follows to obtain a deeper understanding of what one can and cannot do using the control structures exposed by abstract syntax trees. val code = \"\"\" void foo () { int x = source(); if (x > 10) { goto end; } while(x++ < MAX) { if(x != 0) { int y = 2*x; sink(y); } } end: } \"\"\" Copy Importing and plotting yields the following: Fig. 4: Abstract syntax tree containing structured and unstructured control structures As we can see in Figure 4, the language formulated so far can be used easily to describe nested constructs. For example, if we would like to identify all calls to sink nested in an if-block that is itself nested in a while block, we could use the following query: cpg.call(\"sink\") .inAst.isControlStructure.controlStructureType(\"IF\") .inAst.isControlStructure.controlStructureType(\"WHILE\").l => List[ControlStructure] = List( ControlStructure( id -> 1000112L, argumentIndex -> 4, argumentName -> None, code -> \"while(x++ < MAX)\", columnNumber -> Some(value = 2), controlStructureType -> \"WHILE\", lineNumber -> Some(value = 9), order -> 4, parserTypeName -> \"WhileStatement\" ) ) Copy Alternatively, we can walk the tree from its top to achieve the same:  cpg.method .controlStructure(\"while.*\") .ast.isControlStructure.controlStructureType(\"IF\") .ast.isCallTo(\"sink\").l => List[Call] = List( Call( id -> 1000129L, argumentIndex -> 3, argumentName -> None, code -> \"sink(y)\", columnNumber -> Some(value = 8), dispatchType -> \"STATIC_DISPATCH\", lineNumber -> Some(value = 12), methodFullName -> \"sink\", name -> \"sink\", order -> 3, signature -> \"TODO\", typeFullName -> \"<empty>\" ) ) Copy While the syntax tree is not primarily concerned with exposing control flow, when a function only contains structured control structures such as if blocks or while loops, limited reasoning about control flow is possible. For example, since the call to sink is nested inside the if block and while loop, we can be certain that the conditions introduced by these two control structures are evaluated at least once before sink is called. We can also be certain that a sibling tree to the left is executed before a tree itself. This, however, does not work in the face of unstructured control flow as introduced by goto. We make these statements as well as their jump targets visible in the tree, however, allowing functions where control flow must be analyzed with control flow graphs can be determined.

Joern creates semantic code property graphs from the fuzzy parser output and stores them in an in-memory graph database. SCPGs are a language-agnostic intermediate representation of code designed for query-based code analysis. Taint Analysis. Joern provides a taint-analysis engine that allows the propagation of attacker-controlled data in the code to be analyzed statically. Search Queries. Joern offers a stronly-typed Scala-based extensible query language for code analysis based on Gremlin-Scala. This language can be used to manually formulate search queries for vulnerabilities as well as automatically infer them using machine learning techniques. Extendable via CPG passes. Code property graphs are multi-layered, offering information about code on different levels of abstraction. Joern comes with many default passes, but also allows users to add passes to include additional information in the graph, and extend the query language accordingly.

"},{"title":"Joern Projects","type":1,"pageTitle":"Workspace","url":"organizing-projects#joern-projects","content":"A Joern Project is a collection of files related to a single analysis. Just like the Joern Workspace, Joern Projects are represented by directories on your filesystem. Each project directory contains the project metadata (like its name, or the absolute path of the program under analysis), a binary representation of the Code Property Graph for the program under analysis, and, optionally, binary representations of the Code Property Graph Overlays that have been generated. Other files may be part of project directories, but we will leave their description for later. For now, let us create two Joern Projects using the importCode top-level command of the Joern Shell. importCode does four things: 1) it creates a new Joern Project for a program found at a path, 2) it generates a Code Property Graph for that program, 3) it loads the generated Code Property Graph into memory, and 4) it generates Code Property Graph Overlays for that Code Property Graph. For the purposes of this demonstration, you will create the two Joern Projects from a sample program named X42. Clone the following git repository which contains its implementation in a few different programming languages: $ git clone https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/x42.git Copy Now run importCode, first for the C implementation of the X42 program: joern> importCode(\"./x42/c\", \"x42-c\") Creating project `x42-c` for code at `./x42/c` // ...output trimmed res1: Option[Cpg] = Some(io.shiftleft.codepropertygraph.Cpg@7923e12c) Copy note If you see an error and a return value of None, you have probably pointed Joern to the wrong input path for the directory containing the source code for the sample project. Ensure it is correct by navigating to the git repository you cloned and using its absolute path in the importCode command. Then, for the Java implementation of the same X42 program: joern> importCode(\"./x42/java/X42.jar\", \"x42-java\") Creating project `x42-java` for code at `./x42/java/X42.jar` // ...output trimmed res2: Option[Cpg] = Some(io.shiftleft.codepropertygraph.Cpg@5d41bf70) Copy If you did everything right, the output of workspace will look something like this: joern> workspace res3: io.shiftleft.console.workspacehandling.WorkspaceManager[io.shiftleft.repl.JoernProject] = ____________________________________________________________________________ | name | overlays | inputPath | open| |==========================================================================| | x42-java| semanticcpg,dataflow,tagging| /home/user/x42/java/X42.jar| true| | x42-c | semanticcpg,dataflow,tagging| /home/user/x42/c | true| Copy The output is fairly self-explanatory. The Joern Workspace contains two Joern Projects, one named x42-c and one named x42-java. The second column, overlays, lists the Code Property Graph Overlays that have been created for each project. Values in the inputPath column refer to the absolute filesystem paths of the programs these projects represent. And finally, open specifies whether the Code Property Graphs are currently loaded in memory. note You might have noticed that the paths pointing to the different language implementations of the X42 program differ slightly. One points to a directory, another to a file. That is because of the way Joern creates Code Property Graphs for programs. For Java, JAR files are supported. For other languages, directories with source files. Each Joern Shell session has one active project at a time, and you can find out which one it is using the project command: joern> project res4: io.shiftleft.repl.JoernProject = Project( ProjectFile(\"/home/user/x42/c\", \"x42-c\"), /home/user/.shiftleft/joern/workspace/x42-c, Some(io.shiftleft.codepropertygraph.Cpg@28ce038d) ) Copy The active project is the project which contains the Code Property Graph you want to focus your analysis on at a given time. Some important Joern Shell commands always refer to the current active project. For example, if you run cpg.metaData.l, the return value will be the META_DATA node of the Code Property Graph of the currently active project, which in this case, is x42-c: joern> cpg.metaData.l res5: List[MetaData] = List( MetaData( id -> 1L, hash -> None, language -> \"C\", overlays -> List(\"semanticcpg\"), version -> \"0.1\" ) ) Copy If instead you'd like access to the META_DATA node of the x42-java project, you'd first make it the active project using workspace.setActiveProject: joern> workspace.setActiveProject(\"x42-java\") res6: Option[io.shiftleft.repl.JoernProject] = Some( Project( ProjectFile(\"/home/user/x42/java/X42.jar\", \"x42-java\"), /home/user/.shiftleft/joern/workspace/x42-java, Some(io.shiftleft.codepropertygraph.Cpg@13a6e76f) ) ) Copy And then run the cpg.metaData.l command again to see its META_DATA node: joern> cpg.metaData.l res7: List[MetaData] = List( MetaData( id -> 1L, language -> \"JAVA\", version -> \"0.1\", overlays -> List(\"semanticcpg\", \"dataflow\", \"tagging\"), policyDirectories -> List(), spid -> None ) ) Copy Other top-level commands that refer to the currently active project are run, open, close, delete and undo. That concludes this gentle introducton into the commands the Joern Shell provides you with for organizing your Joern Projects. Have fun with your analysis!

By default, we get three flows as follows: $ joern joern> workspace.reset joern> importCpg(\"/tmp/main.cpg.bin.zip\") joern> run.ossdataflow joern> def source = cpg.call(\"free\").argument joern> def sink = cpg.call(\"free\").argument joern> sink.reachableByFlows(source).p res54: List[String] = List( \"\"\"______________________________________ | tracked| lineNumber| method| file | |=====================================| | free | 12 | main | main.c | \"\"\", \"\"\"______________________________________ | tracked| lineNumber| method| file | |=====================================| | free | 10 | main | main.c | \"\"\", \"\"\"______________________________________ | tracked| lineNumber| method| file | |=====================================| | free | 10 | main | main.c | | free | 12 | main | main.c | \"\"\" ) Copy The first two are 'loops': there is a flow from the free to itself. We can filter these results out by only asking for flows that are longer than one: joern> sink.reachableByFlows(source).filter(f => f.elements.size > 1).p res55: List[String] = List( \"\"\"______________________________________ | tracked| lineNumber| method| file | |=====================================| | free | 10 | main | main.c | | free | 12 | main | main.c | \"\"\" ) Copy Which yields the double-free bug in the program! "},{"title":"Joern Scan","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"scan","content":"This article is a brief introduction to Joern Scan, a code scanner built on top of Joern. Joern Scan helps you detect security issues inside programs and can help guide your vulnerability discovery and variant analysis processes. Whether you're looking for the usage of insecure functions like strcpy, instances ofuse-after-free, or are trying to find methods with a high number of conditionals for a closer inspection, this tool is for you. Let's start by looking at a simple example. To follow along, install Joern byfollowing these instructions, it comes pre-packaged with Joern Scan. Given the following simple program written in C: // simple.c #include <stdio.h> int main () { char str[50]; printf(\"Enter a string : \"); gets(str); printf(\"You entered: %s\", str); return(0); } Copy You can run Joern Scan by providing the filepath as input: $ joern-scan simple.c Detailed logs at: /tmp/joern-scan-log.txt Result: 8.0 : Dangerous function gets() used: /home/user/code/simple.c:6:main Copy Behind the scenes of this invocation, three things happen: The Code Property Graph for simple.c is generatedA set of pre-defined queries are executed against the Code Property Graph representation of simple.cFinally, the results are printed to stdout The results are the most visible bit. They follow the format: Result: $QUERY_SCORE : $QUERY_TITLE: $FILEPATH:$LINE_NUMBER:$FUNCTION_NAME Copy Results tell you if a Query matched, and where. The Queries are the most important bit. At a minimum, they have a unique name, a score, a description, and a traversal. This is an example of how a query is defined: def getsUsed(): Query = Query.make( name = \"call-to-gets\", author = Crew.suchakra, title = \"Dangerous function gets() used\", description = \"\"\" | Avoid `gets` function as it can lead to reads beyond buffer | boundary and cause | buffer overflows. Some secure alternatives are `fgets` and `gets_s`. |\"\"\".stripMargin, score = 8, withStrRep({ cpg => cpg.method(\"gets\").callIn }), tags = List(QueryTags.badfn) ) Copy cpg.method(\"gets\").callIn is the graph traversal of the Query. It is wrapped in the withStrRep function for functional purposes, namely to generate a string representation of it for display. Joern Scan ships with a default set of queries, the Joern Query Database. This set of queries is constantly updated, and contributions are highly encouragedhttps://github.com/joernio/joern/tree/master/querydb. You can fetch the latest version of the Joern Query Database using the --updatedb flag: $ joern-scan --updatedb Downloading default query bundle from: https://github.com/joernio/joern/releases/download/v1.1.919/querydb.zip Wrote: 10785252 bytes to /tmp/joern-scan4746805711015614603/querydb.zip Removing current version of query database Schema directory at /home/user/joern/schema-extender/schemas does not exist Adding updated version of query database Schema directory at /home/user/joern/schema-extender/schemas does not exist Copy All queries which contain the default tag will be tested against a program under analysis, but you can also selectively choose which ones to run. You can specify a set of tags, for example: $ joern-scan simple.c --tags badfn Detailed logs at: /tmp/joern-scan-log.txt Result: 8.0 : Dangerous function gets() used: /home/user/code/simple.c:17:main Copy Or use the tag placeholder all to choose all queries: $ joern-scan simple.c --tags all Detailed logs at: /tmp/joern-scan-log.txt Result: 1.0 : Multiple returns: /home/user/code/simple.c:3:add2 Result: 8.0 : Dangerous function gets() used: /home/user/code/simple.c:17:main Copy Alternatively, you can choose queries using their names: $ joern-scan simple.c --names call-to-gets,multiple-returns Detailed logs at: /tmp/joern-scan-log.txt Result: 1.0 : Multiple returns: /home/user/code/simple.c:3:add2 Result: 8.0 : Dangerous function gets() used: /home/user/code/simple.c:17:main Copy One other CLI argument you will find useful is --overwrite. --overwriteforces Joern Scan to regenerate a Code Property Graph for the program under analysis. You will want to use this flag whenever significant changes are introduced into a program which you've scanned before. Keep in mind that regenerating Code Property Graphs for large codebases will take some time. $ joern-scan simple.c --overwrite Detailed logs at: /tmp/joern-scan-log.txt Result: 8.0 : Dangerous function gets() used: /home/user/code/simple.c:6:main Copy That concludes everything you need to know about how to use Joern Scan.

The HTTP API allows posting queries and obtaining responses. Additionally, a Websocket is offered that clients can subscribe to in order to be notified by the server when query responses are available. This will spawn a web server on port 8080 with the following functionality: Route\tDescription\tMethod\tPOST Body\tResponse Body/query\tSubmit query\tPOST\t{\"query\": $query}\t{\"uuid\": \"$uuid\"} /result/$uuid\tRetrieve response\tGET\t-\t{\"success\": \"{true, false}\", \"stdout\": \"$stdout\", \"stderr\" : \"$stderr\"} where $query is the query to be executed, $uuid is an id assigned to the query by the server upon receipt, and $stdout and $stderris the data written by the interpreter to standard output and standard error respectively in response to the query. If a response for a query is not yet available, the response body is of the form {\"success\" : \"false\", ...} and the client is expected to ask for the response at a later point in time. For interactive use cases, this polling approach may be problematic. In this case, the client can subscribe to a Websocket offered via ws://$hostname:8080/connect Copy where $hostname is the name of the host on which the server is running. Once subscribed, uuids of completed queries are reported on the web socket. note Note that the server exclusively implements remote access to an interpreter, it does not implement sandboxing. As such, it is not to be considered a security boundary and sandboxing must be achieved via other means in production environments.

For exanple, `cpg.method.l` lists all methods, while `cpg.finding.l` lists all findings of potentially vulnerable code.\"\"\" Copy "},{"title":"Solving the Challenge","type":1,"pageTitle":"Quickstart","url":"quickstart#solving-the-challenge","content":"Now that we have a good set of basic commands, and a Code Property Graph loaded in memory, let us return to our X42 program and the problem we want to solve using Joern. To reiterate, the problem statement is Show that an input exists for which the X42 program always writes a string to STDERR. And this is the X42 program: // X42.c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], \"42\") == 0) { fprintf(stderr, \"It depends!\\n\"); exit(42); } printf(\"What is the meaning of life?\\n\"); exit(0); } There are two parts in the problem statement: 1. does the program write anything to STDERR?, and 2. _if there is a call writing to STDERR, is it conditional on a value passed in as argument to theX42 program? Joern makes answering both questions easy. To answer the first one, whether the program writes anything to STDERR, we can search for nodes of type CALL in the graph, then use the argument step to only select those calls which have connections to nodes of type ARGUMENT, followed by the code(\"stderr\") property filter step which selects only those nodes that have the string stderr as the value of their CODEproperty. We find exactly one: joern> cpg.call.argument.code(\"stderr\").toList res3: List[Expression] = List( Identifier( id -> 1000118L, argumentIndex -> 1, argumentName -> None, code -> \"stderr\", columnNumber -> Some(value = 12), lineNumber -> Some(value = 7), name -> \"stderr\", order -> 1, typeFullName -> \"ANY\" ) ) Copy This query shows that stderr is used somewhere in the program, but doesn't give us any more information. Using the query from the previous step, we can use the astParent construct to find out more about the surroundings of the stderr usage by moving up the hierarchy of the abstract syntax tree that is part of the Code Property Graph. Moving up one level in the AST hierarchy gives us an fprintf call: joern> cpg.call.argument.code(\"stderr\").astParent.toList res4: List[AstNode] = List( Call( id -> 1000117L, argumentIndex -> 1, argumentName -> None, code -> \"fprintf(stderr, \\\"It depends!\\\\n\\\")\", columnNumber -> Some(value = 4), dispatchType -> \"STATIC_DISPATCH\", lineNumber -> Some(value = 7), methodFullName -> \"fprintf\", name -> \"fprintf\", order -> 1, signature -> \"TODO\", typeFullName -> \"<empty>\" ) ) Copy With this query we have proven the first part of our problem statement correct, there is a place in the X42 program that writes to STDERR. Let us move to the second part, the check whether the call that writes something to STDERR is conditional on a value passed as input to the X42 program. Since we are analyzing a program written in C, we will search the Code Property Graph for the conventional argc or argv parameters of the main function as the input that potentially triggers the call which writes to STDERR. As before, we can use the astParent to move up the AST. Moving up another level in the AST hierarchy gives us a block; not very helpful: joern> cpg.call.argument.code(\"stderr\").astParent.astParent.toList res5: List[AstNode] = List( Block( id -> 1000116L, argumentIndex -> 2, argumentName -> None, code -> \"\", columnNumber -> Some(value = 46), lineNumber -> Some(value = 6), order -> 2, typeFullName -> \"void\" ) ) Copy Another layer up gives us an if statement, much better: joern> cpg.call.argument.code(\"stderr\").astParent.astParent.astParent.toList res6: List[AstNode] = List( ControlStructure( id -> 1000104L, argumentIndex -> 1, argumentName -> None, code -> \"if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], \\\"42\\\") == 0)\", columnNumber -> Some(value = 2), controlStructureType -> \"IF\", lineNumber -> Some(value = 6), order -> 1, parserTypeName -> \"IfStatement\" ) ) Copy The CODE property of the CONTROL_STRUCTURE node you just found proves the second part of our problem statement correct, the call that writes to STDERR is conditional on argc and argv. Hence, the whole problem statement is correct.

Background: CPGQL was previously based on the Gremlin graph traversal language (accessible via .raw), and is now based on OverflowDb Traversal. The main drivers behind this change are: better performance, less complexity and fewer dependencies. OverflowDb Traversal is a Scala collection with additional graph steps, which means we now inherit many useful steps from the rich Scala standard collection library, where previously convertions between Traversal and Scala collections were needed. At the same time, Traversal offers largely the same steps and semantics as its TinkerPop predecessor. Here are the most important new parts - from our experience the swap of filter and where accounts for 90% of user-facing changes: filter(A => Boolean): just like any other Scala collection, filter now simply takes a predicate (it used to take a Traversal). where(trav: Traversal[A] => Traversal[_]): preserves elements if the provided traversal has at least one result. This is what filter used to be.Effectively, filter and where are swapped. RIP filterOnEnd - this is now simply filter repeat now has a builder DSL to configure it's behaviour, which is more specific and easier to understand than tinkerpop's api, which relied on the order of modulators in the traversal. For example, in tinkerpop .emit.repeat(Traversal) means \"emit everything\", while .repeat(Traversal).emit means \"emit all but the first element\". In OverflowDb Traversal this behaviour is more explicit: .repeat(Traversal)(_.emit) and .repeat(Traversal)(_.emitAllButFirst). Some more examples for the migration: .repeat(x).until(y) -> .repeat(x)(_.until(y)).emit.repeat(x) -> .repeat(x)(_.emit).repeat(x).emit -> .repeat(x)(_.emitAllButFirst).emit.repeat(x).times(2) -> .repeat(x)(_.emit.times(2)) repeat uses depth first search (DFS) by default and can be configured to use breadth first search (BFS) instead. Tinkerpop has a long standing issue that it claims to use DFS but actually uses BFS, and also cannot be configured to use one or the other. .start step only exists for Node and NewNode, not for other collections any more. Instead, use the standard scala collection mechanism .to(Traversal): // still works - nothing changed: val someMethod = cpg.method.head someMethod.start.parameter //Traversal[MethodParameterIn] // using `.to(Traversal)` - standard scala collection mechanism val methodList: cpg.method.l methodList.to(Traversal) //Traversal[Method] Copy .clone doesn't exist any more - note that Traversals typically have Iterator semantics, i.e. they are consumed during iteration: val source = cpg.identifier.name(\"foo\") val sink = cpg.call.name(\"bar\") sink.reachableByFlows(source).l //contains flows (if any) sink.reachableByFlows(source).l //always empty - both source and sink Traversals have been consumed! Copy If you want to execute your traversals multiple times, simply define them as a function (def) rather than a value (val): def source = cpg.identifier.name(\"foo\") def sink = cpg.call.name(\"bar\") sink.reachableByFlows(source).l //contains flows (if any) sink.reachableByFlows(source).l //same result: also contains flows (if any) Copy Please let us know if you need help with your migration, either by opening an issue or asking on gitter.

As an example, the query cpg.method.name.toList Copy returns all names of methods present in a Code Property Graph and can be dissected as follows: cpg is the root object, method is a node-type step which references all METHOD nodes, name is a property directive which references the NAME property of those METHOD nodes, and toList is an execution directive which executes the traversal and returns the result as a list.

At the Joern prompt, type cpg and press ENTER: joern> cpg res1: Cpg = io.shiftleft.codepropertygraph.Cpg@ab90fdab Copy The executed query consists only of the root object cpg. The return value of that execution is a reference to the Code Property Graph and the reference itself is suffixed by a hexadecimal string (in this case @ab90fdab) that uniquely identifies it. We proceed to add the metaData node-type step to the query. This step represents a traversal to all nodes of type METADATA (of which there is only one): joern> cpg.metaData res2: Traversal[MetaData] = Traversal Copy Note that the result is not the content of the METADATA node, but a traversal that visits the METADATA node. In other words, Traversals are lazily evaluated - you can compose them and at some later point execute them, as we will see. This behaviour points to the ephemeral nature of queries: each query is separate from the other, and Joern holds distinct in-memory representations for them. The only object shared between queries is the root object (cpg). Traversals are executed - as opposed to just to being held in memory - using execution directives such as toList. The directive toList executes the traversal and returns results in a list: joern> cpg.metaData.toList res3: List[MetaData] = List( MetaData( id -> 1L, hash -> None, language -> \"NEWC\", overlays -> List(\"semanticcpg\"), version -> \"0.1\" ) ) Copy In the result of this query, we already see the LANGUAGE field and that it is C. For the sake of completeness and to illustrate property directives, let us add the property directive language to the query. Property directives provide access to individual node properties. Each node-type step can be combined with different property directives, and they usually match the properties defined on the node type represented by the node-type step: joern> cpg.metaData.language.toList res4: List[String] = List(\"NEWC\") Copy With this last query, we have achieved our goal of executing a traversal which returns the LANGUAGE property of the METADATA node of the X42 program. "},{"title":"Node-Type Steps","type":1,"pageTitle":"Traversal Basics","url":"traversal-basics#node-type-steps","content":"Node-Type Steps are atomic traversals that represent traversals to nodes of a given type. Each node-type step comes with distinct Property Directives to access the properties of the nodes they represent. Let us revisit the source code of the x42 program to illustrate node-type steps. // X42.c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], \"42\") == 0) { fprintf(stderr, \"It depends!\\n\"); exit(42); } printf(\"What is the meaning of life?\\n\"); exit(0); } Copy A commonly used node-type step is method, which represents a traversal to all nodes of type METHOD. METHOD nodes represent declarations of methods, functions or procedures in programs, and one of their properties is NAME. All names of all method nodes can thus be determined as follows: joern > cpg.method.name.l res4: List[String] = List( \"main\", \"fprintf\", \"exit\", \"<operator>.logicalAnd\", \"<operator>.equals\", \"<operator>.greaterThan\", \"strcmp\", \"<operator>.indirectIndexAccess\", \"printf\" ) Copy The number of METHOD nodes may surprise you, given that the program only defines the single method main explicitly. The Code Property Graph, however, also includes method nodes for all methods invoked by the code. Moreover, built-in operators are modeled as methods, one decision made to enable language-agnostic analysis. We will look into the details of node-type steps in a different article. For now, it is sufficient to know that Joern offers these steps for all common node types: method, call, argument, parameter, metaData, local, literal, types, returns, identifier, namespace, namespaceBlock, methodReturn, typeDecl, member, methodRef, file, comment, tag and the generic all. "},{"title":"Filter Steps","type":1,"pageTitle":"Traversal Basics","url":"traversal-basics#filter-steps","content":"Filter Steps are atomic traversals that filter nodes according to given criteria. The most common filter step is aptly-named filter, which continues the traversal in the step it suffixes for all nodes which pass its criterion. Its criterion is represented by a lamba function which has access to the node of the previous step and returns a boolean. Continuing with the previous example, let us execute a query which returns all METHOD nodes of the Code Property Graph for X42, but only if their IS_EXTERNAL property is set to false: joern> cpg.method.filter(_.isExternal == false).name.toList res11: List[String] = List(\"main\") Copy note A note on Scala lambda functions: In the example above, we used the lambda function _.isExternal == false as the predicate for the filter. The _ is simply syntactic sugar referring to the parameter of the function, so this could be rewritten as method => method.isExternal == false. Dissecting this query, we have cpg as the root object, a node-type step method which returns all nodes of type METHOD, a filter step where(_.isExternal == false) which continues the traversal only for nodes which have their IS_EXTERNAL property set to false (with _ referencing the individual nodes, and isExternal a property directive which accesses their IS_EXTERNAL property), followed by a property directive name which returns the values of the NAME property of the nodes that passed the Filter Step, and finally an Execution Directive toList which executes the traversal and returns the results in a list. A shorter version of a query which returns the same results as the one above can be written using a Property-Filter Step. Property-filter steps are Filter Steps which continue the traversal only for nodes which have a specific value in the property the Property Filter Step refers to: joern> cpg.method.isExternal(false).name.toList res11: List[String] = List(\"main\") Copy Dissecting the query again, cpg is the root object, method is a node-type step, isExternal(false) is a property-filter step that filters for nodes which have false as the value of their IS_EXTERNAL property, name is a property directive, and toList is the execution directive you are already familiar with. note Be careful not to mix up property directives with property-filter steps, they look awfully similar. Consider that: a) cpg.method.isExternal(true).name.toList returns all METHOD nodes which have the IS_EXTERNAL property set to true (in this case, 10 results) b) cpg.method.isExternal.toList returns the value of the IS_EXTERNAL property for all METHOD nodes in the graph (12 results) c) cpg.method.isExternal.name.toList is an invalid query which will not execute A final Filter Step we will look at is named where. Unlike filter, this doesn't take a simple predicate A => Boolean, but instead takes a Traversal[A] => Traversal[_]. I.e. you supply a traversal which will be executed at the current position. The resulting Traversal will preserves elements if the provided traversal has at least one result. The previous query that used a Property Filter Step can be re-written using where like so: joern> cpg.method.where(_.isExternal(false)).name.toList res24: List[String] = List(\"main\") Copy Maybe not particulary useful-seeming given this specific example, but keep it in the back of your head, because filter is a handy tool to have in the toolbox. Next up, Map Steps. "},{"title":"Map Steps","type":1,"pageTitle":"Traversal Basics","url":"traversal-basics#map-steps","content":"Map Steps are traversals that map a set of nodes into a different form given a function. Map Steps are a powerful mechanism when you need to transform results to fit your specifics. For example, say you'd like to return both the IS_EXTERNAL and the NAME properties of all METHOD nodes in X42's Code Property Graph. You can achieve that with the following query: joern> cpg.method.map(node => (node.isExternal, node.name)).toList res6: List[(Boolean, String)] = List( (false, \"main\"), (true, \"fprintf\"), (true, \"exit\"), (true, \"<operator>.logicalAnd\"), (true, \"<operator>.equals\"), (true, \"<operator>.greaterThan\"), (true, \"strcmp\"), (true, \"<operator>.indirectIndexAccess\"), (true, \"printf\") ) Copy Don't be intimidated by the syntax used in the map Step above. If you examine map(node => (node.isExternal, node.name)) for a bit, you might be able to infer that the first node simply defines the variable that represents the node which preceeds the map Step, that the ASCII arrow => is just syntax that preceeds the body of a lambda function, and that (node.isExternal, node.name) means that the return value of the lambda is a list which contains the value of the isExternal and name Property Directives for each of the nodes matched in the previous step and also passed into the lambda. In most cases in which you need map, you can simply follow the pattern above. But should you ever feel constrained by the common pattern shown, remember that the function for the map step is written in the Scala programming language, a fact which opens up a wide range of possibilities if you invest a little time learning the language. "},{"title":"Complex Steps","type":1,"pageTitle":"Traversal Basics","url":"traversal-basics#complex-steps","content":"Another useful Joern Query Component is the Complex Step. Complex Steps combine many simpler steps into one in order to make your queries more concise. There are a number of them available, all with different behaviours, and one good example is isConstructor. Before we use it in a query, here is the X42 program again: // X42.c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], \"42\") == 0) { fprintf(stderr, \"It depends!\\n\"); exit(42); } printf(\"What is the meaning of life?\\n\"); exit(0); } Copy Earlier we queried it for all METHOD nodes which had their IS_EXTERNAL property set to false using the isExternal(false) Property Filter Step. Two results came up, even though only one method is explicitly defined: joern> cpg.method.isExternal(false).name.l res103: List[String] = List(\"main\") Copy Two useful Complex Steps are astParent and astChildren, which allow you to steer your traversals through the abstract syntax tree of the program under analysis. Say you'd like to have a query that returns the CODE property for all nodes of type LITERAL which are AST child nodes of CALL nodes that have printf in their NAME property: joern> cpg.call.name(\"printf\").astChildren.isLiteral.code.l res30: List[String] = List(\"\\\"What is the meaning of life?\\\\n\\\"\") Copy Or taken the other way around, a query which returns the property of all CALL nodes which have AST parent nodes of type LITERAL that have their CODE property set to \\\"What is the meaning of life?\\\": joern> cpg.literal.filter(_.code == \"\\\"What is the meaning of life?\\\\n\\\"\").astParent.isCall.name.toList res100: List[String] = List(\"printf\") Copy Describing queries in human language tends to sound peculiar. But so would descriptions of bash one-liners, or basic regular expressions if you'd try out that exercise. As long as you understand the individual components of a query, it won't be hard to construct them correctly and understand clearly what they do.

"},{"title":"Repeat Steps","type":1,"pageTitle":"Traversal Basics","url":"traversal-basics#repeat-steps","content":"There are cases in which queries have repetitions in them and become too long. In order to make them more readable, you can use Repeat Steps. Repeat Steps are traversals that repeat other traversals a number of times. For example, say you'd like to find nodes of type LITERAL in X42's Code Property Graph that are directly reachable from the node which represents the main method. One way of doing that is by using five astChildren Complex Steps in combination with isLiteral, which is another Complex Step that filters for AST nodes of type LITERAL and maps them to actual LITERAL nodes, plus the code(\"42\") Property Filter Step: joern> cpg.method.name(\"main\").astChildren.astChildren.astChildren.astChildren.astChildren.isLiteral.code(\"42\").toList res32: List[Literal] = List( Literal( id -> 1000121L, argumentIndex -> 1, argumentName -> None, code -> \"42\", columnNumber -> Some(value = 9), lineNumber -> Some(value = 8), order -> 1, typeFullName -> \"int\" ) ) Copy The query might do the job, but it is hard to read and change. repeat-times makes the query clearer: joern> cpg.method.name(\"main\").repeat(_.astChildren)(_.times(5)).isLiteral.code(\"42\").l res33: List[Literal] = List( Literal( id -> 1000121L, argumentIndex -> 1, argumentName -> None, code -> \"42\", columnNumber -> Some(value = 9), lineNumber -> Some(value = 8), order -> 1, typeFullName -> \"int\" ) ) Copy And even better is another variant of repeat, namely repeat-until: joern> cpg.method.name(\"main\").repeat(_.astChildren)(_.until(_.isLiteral.code(\"42\"))).l res34: List[AstNode] = List( Literal( id -> 1000121L, argumentIndex -> 1, argumentName -> None, code -> \"42\", columnNumber -> Some(value = 9), lineNumber -> Some(value = 8), order -> 1, typeFullName -> \"int\" ) ) Copy info Joern traversals implement Scala's IterableOps trait. It is therefore possible to use all of the methods listed in the IterableOps documentationon Traversals. We won't go any further in this article. If you've read so far, you already have a good overview of the most important Joern Query Components. And while the examples you've seen focused on the simple X42 program, rest assured, queries that find serious vulnerabilities in programs with millions of lines of code are not much different.
